## Example Portfolio Template :sparkles:

I wanted to create a template that I could potentially use for creating portfolio sites. Essentially it's an example portfolio! 
Some of the images already have the gradient borders around them which I added in Figma instead of doing it via Tailwind

## Frameworks :hammer:
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
- Next.js 
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Deployment :zap:
- Deployed on Vercel
- Vercel for analytics
- https://example-portfolio-template.vercel.app/
